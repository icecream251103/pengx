## Oracle Configuration

### Production Oracle Setup

#### Chainlink Integration
```solidity
// Mainnet Gold/USD Feed
address constant CHAINLINK_GOLD_USD = 0x214eD9Da11D2fbe465a6fc601a91E62EbEc1a0D6;

// Configuration
uint256 weight = 6000; // 60% weight
uint256 maxStaleness = 3600; // 1 hour
```

#### Band Protocol Integration
```solidity
// Band Protocol Reference
string constant BAND_BASE = "XAU";
string constant BAND_QUOTE = "USD";

// Configuration
uint256 weight = 4000; // 40% weight
uint256 maxStaleness = 1800; // 30 minutes
```
