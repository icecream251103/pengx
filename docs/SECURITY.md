# PentaGold Security Framework

## Overview

PentaGold (PenGx) implements a comprehensive security framework designed to protect users and ensure the integrity of the synthetic gold token system. This document outlines our security measures, audit procedures, and best practices.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Smart Contract Security

#### Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for granular permissions
- **Multi-Signature Requirements**: Critical operations require multiple signatures
- **Timelock Governance**: 48-hour minimum delay for administrative changes
- **Emergency Pause**: Immediate halt capability for critical situations

#### Key Roles
```solidity
- DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE: Overall contract administration
- MINTER_ROLE: Token minting permissions
- PAUSER_ROLE: Emergency pause capabilities
- UPGRADER_ROLE: Contract upgrade authorization
- ORACLE_MANAGER_ROLE: Oracle configuration management
- EMERGENCY_ROLE: Emergency response functions
```

#### Upgrade Safety
- **UUPS Proxy Pattern**: Secure upgradeable contracts
- **Timelock Protection**: All upgrades subject to 48-hour delay
- **Role Verification**: Only authorized upgraders can propose changes
- **Implementation Validation**: Comprehensive checks before upgrade execution

### 2. Oracle Security

#### Multi-Source Aggregation
- **Chainlink Integration**: Primary price feed from Chainlink oracles
- **Band Protocol**: Secondary price validation
- **Custom Oracles**: Additional data sources for redundancy
- **Weighted Average**: Configurable weights for different oracle sources

#### Price Validation
- **Staleness Checks**: Maximum 1-hour age for price data
- **Deviation Limits**: 3% maximum deviation between oracle sources
- **Confidence Scoring**: Minimum 80% confidence threshold
- **Outlier Detection**: Automatic filtering of anomalous price data

#### Circuit Breaker System
```solidity
struct CircuitBreakerConfig {
    uint256 priceDeviationThreshold; // 5% maximum price movement
    uint256 timeWindow;              // 5-minute observation window
    uint256 cooldownPeriod;          // 1-hour recovery period
    bool isActive;                   // Enable/disable functionality
}
```

### 3. Economic Security

#### Fee Structure
- **Mint Fee**: 0.5% (50 basis points)
- **Redeem Fee**: 0.5% (50 basis points)
- **Maximum Fee Cap**: 10% hard limit in smart contract
- **Fee Recipient**: Configurable treasury address

#### Supply Controls
- **Maximum Supply**: 100 million PenGx tokens
- **Minimum Mint**: 0.001 PenGx per transaction
- **Maximum Mint**: 1 million PenGx per transaction
- **Slippage Protection**: User-defined minimum output amounts

#### Liquidity Protection
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent extreme price movements
- **Emergency Pause**: Halt trading during market stress
- **Gradual Unwinding**: Controlled redemption during high volatility

### 4. Operational Security
